I'm not going to do that, per se.
Editor wars are way too contentious, and I'm saying this as someone who has seen Saint IGNU-cius
in person.

about the lineage of Neovim, all the way back to 1965 with the <tt>qed</tt> line editor, back in the
pre-UNIX days. <tt>qed</tt> gave way to <tt>ed</tt> (which you can use on our production servers for

This rough, truncated timeline gives you an idea of when some of the now-popular features were
added. I'm pretty sure that I started using Vim in the early 2000s by downloading GVim for
Windows.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="3" id="freezing-problems" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="4800" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="vim-s-freezing-problems">Vim's Freezing Problems</h1><ul><li>Plugins with CPU/IO-intensive code lock up the editor.

limitations. The elephant in the room was its freezing problems. It was more-or-less fine with
opening large files, but if a plugin happened to operate on one, that was another matter
entirely. This was because Vim commands were all synchronous. The plugins listed were among the
ones affected by this problem. Another example is if you use vim-bundler and run <tt>:Bundle</tt>,
because it uses the built-in <tt>:make</tt> command, you won't be able to edit any of your documents
until Bundler finishes.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="4" id="neovim-history" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="6400" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="neovim-begins-with-multithreading">Neovim Begins: With Multithreading?</h1><ul><li>2013-12-04: Experimental branch to introduce threading, by Thiago Arruda (BR)</li><li>2014-02-21: Bountysource fundraiser launched</li><li>2014-03-23: Raises $33,966 out of $10,000</li><li>2015-11-01: Neovim 0.1 released</li></ul><div class="notes"><p>At the end of 2013, one developer, Thiago Arruda, tried to fix this by adding multithreading to
Vim. This resulted in zero feedback from Bram, Vim's creator. Frustrated by the development
process, Thiago started a crowdsourced fundraiser so that he could work on a fork of Vim. It
ended up raising more than three times the amount asked, and the first stable version was
released about a year and a half later.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="5" id="initial-goals" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="8000" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="initial-goals">Initial Goals</h1><ul><li>Use GitHub, add more people with the "commit bit"</li><li>Modern build system (cmake)</li><li>Remove legacy OS support (e.g., MSDOS)</li><li>Rewrite plugin architecture with async support</li><li>Make it easier to integrate with GUIs</li><li>Better tests</li></ul><div class="notes"><p>The initial goals ultimately point towards two ideas: increasing bus factor and development
speed. I should point out that all of these high-level goals were achieved, although in some
cases, the initial attempt at implementation did not go so well (as can be the case in software
engineering).</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="6" id="contributors-welcome" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="9600" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="contributors-welcome">Contributors Welcome</h1><a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/5444"><img src="images/neovim-pr.png"></img></a><div class="notes"><p>If that low barrier to entry weren't there, I probably wouldn't have contributed.

by this modern development process. For instance, the truecolor colorscheme support feature was
a third-party patch since at least 2013. A version of that landed in Neovim in 2015. Another
example is Tim Pope's vim-sensible project, which contains "sensible defaults" for Vim. Most of
these settings are now part of the default Neovim config, and the rest have documentation as to
why they were not added. My favorite of these might be the built-in terminal.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="8" id="inccommand" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="12800" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="one-more-thing-incremental-command-live-feedback">One more thing: incremental command live feedback</h1><p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/92207.js" id="asciicast-92207" async></script></p><div class="notes"><p>This last feature landed last week and so I haven't had a chance to try it out, but it looks
pretty nifty.

I've only listed a few. By
"Electron" I mean the Chromium-based app framework that lets you write desktop apps using web
technologies. That's right, at least one person wrote a web component for Neovim.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="10" id="vim-status" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="16000" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="vim-s-status">Vim's status</h1><ul><li>Vim 8.0, released 2016-09-12 (~10 years after 7.0) with some familiar features:<ul><li>Async support</li><li>Dropped support for certain legacy OSes</li><li>Truecolor colorscheme support</li><li>Better tests</li></ul></li></ul><div class="notes"><p>The relative success of the Neovim project must have sparked something in Bram, because Vim
started getting some of the more popular features of Neovim, and version 8 was released with
these changes a couple of months ago.
